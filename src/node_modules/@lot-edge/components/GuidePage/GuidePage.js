                Warsaw is a city that combines history and modernity. When visiting the capital of Poland, it is worth
    seeing the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising, which, through multimedia presentations, tells the story

    of the insurgents. Take a chance to get lost in the historic streets of the Old Town or in the thicket of
    modern skyscrapers in the city center.
